# Robotics Course 6 Capstone Project - Week 1
Dijkstra Algorithm for path search

# How to use
If you run it right now will work only on path2 of the test_for_grader() function.  I have some problems with the algorithm and the arrays. If you want it to work:
1 - Go to the mappos function and follow the steps
2 - Go to the test for grader and disable the map one or two depending on the case


# TODOs
Repair the error for some graphs inputs (probably i will not continue the development)
